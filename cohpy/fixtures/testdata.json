Perhaps others can learn from his mistakes and do as he didn't. This talk will demonstrate how [not] to stitch together Docker, Compose, Machine, Boot2Docker, YAML, CircleCI, EC2, Route53, and likely a few other tools into a simple yet automated code -> commit -> review -> deploy process.</p> ",

Behave uses tests written in a natural language style, backed up by Python code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raymond will teach you how to easily beef up your integrations tests using Python and Gherkin with the Behave BDD Framework. Testing doesn\u2019t have to be hard. Behave makes it easy and fun. </p>",
