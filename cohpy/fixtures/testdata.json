Perhaps others can learn from his mistakes and do as he didn't. This talk will demonstrate how [not] to stitch together Docker, Compose, Machine, Boot2Docker, YAML, CircleCI, EC2, Route53, and likely a few other tools into a simple yet automated code -> commit -> review -> deploy process.</p> "

Behave uses tests written in a natural language style, backed up by Python code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raymond will teach you how to easily beef up your integrations tests using Python and Gherkin with the Behave BDD Framework. Testing doesn\u2019t have to be hard. Behave makes it easy and fun. </p>"

At the heart is an idempotent state management system. Like Chef, Puppet, or . . . Salt. But, it's really easy to use these tools in a way that doesn't leverage their strengths. That's dumb - let's fix that.</p>"

    "description": "<p>This month, Professor Jim Reed will be talking about \"Making Even Better Decisions in Python -- Using IFs with Supporting Assertions\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This talk is for both new Python programmers and old, and you will learn both about the syntax of Python as well as how to code better regardless of your language of choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While offering the NASA/JPL Coding Standards as a backdrop to this presentation--an attempt is made to adhere to these strict standards as Pythonists to develop clean coding habits and better decision making in their Python code. A brief overview of using Python IFs are correctly demonstrated in Python Code according to the NASA Standards presented earlier. A possible pseudo Case/Select Class is explored together as an alternative to Python IFs, but just might not past the test of meeting these self imposed coding standards. And finally, an introduction to the Python Assert Statement is provided with correct usage and demonstrating the suitable usefulness of Assertions for better program design from the beginning of your very next programming project.</p>\r\n"
