A brief overview of using Python IFs are correctly demonstrated in Python Code according to the NASA Standards presented earlier. A possible pseudo Case/Select Class is explored together as an alternative to Python IFs, but just might not past the test of meeting these self imposed coding standards. And finally, an introduction to the Python Assert Statement is provided with correct usage and demonstrating the suitable usefulness of Assertions for better program design from the beginning of your very next programming project.</p>\r\n",
